              <h2>Adopt a Ward Program</h2>
              <p>Take it to the Streets is seeking volunteer groups to participate in our Adopt a Ward program. By using ProPublica's dataset on ticket appeals, your group can target specific areas where tickets are being issued and educate motorists on how to contest their tickets.</p>
              <p>The goals for each working group are:</p>
              <ol>
                    <li>Convince motorists who have been ticketed that they can fight their ticket and potentially win. The success rate of contested tickets will obviously factor into that.</li>
                    <li>Educate users on the types of violations most common in that ward and the types of allowable defenses they can use during a hearing to argue their case.</li>
                    <li>Present them with an organized list of information from the City of Chicago on how to schedule their hearing, as well as give them a template to follow and advice on how they can use rhetorical appeals to argue their case.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>If you're interested in joining our Adopt a Ward program, please contact us at <a class="highlight" href="mailto:info@takeittothestreets.org">info@takeittothestreets.org</a>.</p>

        <section id="success-rate">
              <h2>Contest Your Ticket and Potentially Win</h2>
              <p>Did you know that you can contest your parking ticket and potentially win? Many motorists feel intimidated by the appeals process and either pay their ticket (or, worse, ignore it) rather than attempt to argue their case in court. However, appealing a ticket is a legitimate and effective way to contest unjust or unfair parking citations.</p>
              <p>Take it to the Streets encourages you to challenge your ticket and provides resources to help you construct a strong defense. According to ProPublica's dataset on ticket appeals, success rates vary by ward and violation type, but it's worth noting that some violations have success rates above 50%.</p>
              <p>Don't give up on fighting your ticket. Join our Adopt a Ward program to learn more about contesting your ticket and potentially winning.</p>
